Hey guys my names dislands and I recently started learning how to coed via college. I'm still a bit new and I'd appreciate any tips you could give me. I have no idea how I got to this website, I was recently awarded a citation by our glorius justice system and I decided that I should make sure that I am lying low on the Internet. The upside to it all is that I found this place where I can maybe learn how to code a bit better because.... shits hard. THanks and see ya around.
